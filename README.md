## Bird Image Classification with FastBook 🐦📸

 # Overview 🤔

This repository contains code for classifying bird images using the FastBook library. The code searches for bird images using DuckDuckGo, downloads and resizes them, and trains a CNN model to classify images as either "bird" or "not bird". 🌟

 # Usage 💻

1. Install FastBook 📦: !pip install fastbook
2. Run the code 🏃‍♂: Run the code in a Python environment
3. The code will 🤖:
    - Search for bird images using DuckDuckGo 🦆
    - Download and resize images 📊
    - Train a CNN model to classify images 🤖
4. Predict 🔮: Use the model to predict whether a given image is a bird or not

# Files 📁

- bird_or_not directory: contains the downloaded and resized images 📂
- bird.jpg: a sample image used for prediction 📷

# Code 💻

The code is divided into several sections:

1. Searching for bird images 🔍
2. Downloading and resizing images 📊
3. Creating a DataBlock and dataloaders 📈
4. Training a CNN model 🤖
5. Predicting 🔮

# Results 🎉

The code will output the prediction results, including the probability that the image is a bird 🐦.

# Note 📝

This code is for demonstration purposes only and may not work as-is for your specific use case. You may need to modify the code to suit your needs.
